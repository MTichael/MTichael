- 👋 Hi, I’m @MTichael
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development, UI/UX Design, and learning new languages and practices.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning UI/UX Design and web hosting using a personally developed SPA website built entirely from scratch.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on front-end, back-end, and full-stack projects, especially those utilizing or in need of CI/CD or automated testing.
